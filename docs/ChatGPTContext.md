Awesome — here’s a comprehensive list of enhancement suggestions for your context-aware console log VS Code extension, grouped by category. These ideas aim to improve usability, flexibility, performance, and developer confidence.

🚀 Functional Enhancements
Multi-cursor Support
Currently single-cursor is supported — extend it to insert logs at multiple cursor positions.

Insert Log for Entire File
Add a command to generate logs for all top-level functions/components in a file.

Smart Duplicate Prevention
Detect if a log with similar structure exists and avoid inserting duplicates (configurable).

Insert logger.log() Instead of console.log()
Automatically use logger utility if present (or offer a toggle in settings).

Support for Class Methods (Opt-in)
Support logging inside class component methods (especially useful in legacy codebases).

Support for Nested Functions (Optional)
Currently only top-level — enable nested function detection with depth limit or toggle.

Comment Tagging of Logs
Insert a unique comment like // @contextual-log to track logs for easier cleanup/removal later.

Add Log Above return + Below useEffect/useCallback (Optional)
Allow context logs inside hooks and lifecycle blocks where applicable.

Support Logging in useEffect, useMemo, useCallback (Optional)
Detect hook blocks and log their dependencies + relevant variables.

🎛️ Configurability
Log Format Customization (via settings.json)
Allow users to define their own log templates, e.g.:

json
Copy
Edit
"contextualConsoleLog.template": "logger.debug('[${file} > ${func}]', ${data})"
Selective Context Logging
Let users enable/disable logging for props, state, refs, context, etc. via settings.

Auto-Insert Import If Logger Is Used
Add import { logger } from './logger' if it's not present.

Log Level Control
Let users choose between console.log, console.warn, console.error or logger.log.

Environment Check (DEV Only Logs)
Wrap inserted logs inside:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (**DEV**) {
console.log(...);
}
🧠 Smarts & Contextual Awareness
Detect Destructured useState and Avoid Logging setState ✅ (already handled)

Log .current for useRef ✅ (already handled)

Detect Unused Variables and Avoid Logging Them
Don’t log unused props, state, etc., to reduce clutter.

Parse and Respect JSDoc Annotations
If a function is annotated with @log ignore, skip it.

Auto-cleanup Mode
Add command to delete all logs inserted by the extension (based on tagging comment).

⚙️ Dev Experience
Preview Before Insert ✅ (already planned)

Output Channel for Logs ✅ (already done)

Error Reporting via Telemetry ✅ (already planned)

Undo-friendly Insertions
Ensure log insertions are grouped into a single undo step.

Toggle Log Insertion via Status Bar Icon
Quick enable/disable switch from the VS Code status bar.

🧪 Testing & Debugging
Unit Tests for Each AST Use Case ✅ (already supported)

Snapshot Tests for Output Logs
Confirm that generated logs match expected output in tests.

Log Dry Run
Show a preview (diff-style) of what would be inserted, without actually inserting it.

🧩 Interoperability
Support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and TSX/JSX ✅ (already supported)

Optional: Detect and Log Redux/Context Stores Automatically
Track and log useSelector or useContext(MyContext) for debugging.

Support Monorepo Projects
Handle import paths and logger imports more gracefully across packages.

🔒 Safety & Code Hygiene
Prevent Logging Sensitive Keys (configurable list)
Exclude variables like password, token, etc., from being logged.

Respect .eslintignore and .prettierignore
Avoid inserting logs in ignored files.

🌍 Internationalization / Other
Multi-language Support
Add support for localized log messages or labels (optional, if publishing widely).

Support for Other Loggers (like debug, winston, etc.)
Let user select preferred logger from dropdown or settings.

💡 Suggestion Output Example Toggle
Simple vs. Verbose Logging (Setting)

ts
Copy
Edit
// Simple:
console.log('[App.tsx > App]', { props });

// Verbose:
console.log('[App.tsx > App]', {
props: { title, description },
state: { count },
refs: { countRef: countRef.current }
});
