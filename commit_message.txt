feat: Implement Smart Variable Suggestion

This commit introduces a "Smart Variable Suggestion" feature to enhance the user experience when inserting logs.

Key changes include:
- `src/types.ts`: Added `smartSuggestions` property to `CodeContext` to store intelligently suggested variables.
- `src/parser.ts`: Implemented `getSmartSuggestionsAtCursor` to analyze the AST around the cursor and identify relevant variables (e.g., from variable declarations, assignments, return statements, or function arguments on the current line). These suggestions are then populated into `smartSuggestions`.
- `src/quickPick.ts`: Modified `showVariableQuickPick` to prioritize and display these `smartSuggestions` at the top of the Quick Pick list, making it easier for users to select the most relevant variables for logging.

This feature aims to reduce manual effort and improve the efficiency of adding contextual log statements.
